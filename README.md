# Running the server:
Make sure you have the separate `server` repo installed at the same level as this repo. Don't forget to do `npm install` (or `bun install`) if its your first time downloading the backend (or frontend!).

Do `./run.sh` from the root of the fud folder to run the backend and the frontend simultaneously. Check the commands in the file if you want to know exactly what's happening in there.
